### projekt

Time spent on projects. Measured

---

So yeah, I'm sorry that you see this horrible abomination of a project that i put together in like 3 days mostly in a public transport bus. I believe it to be fully functional but don't take my word for it!

### commands

so this site works by using some retarded commands that are parsed with simple if statements, a lot can propably break.

#### creating steps
```
as $step_name
```
#### removing steps
```
rs $step_name
```
#### creating tasks 
```
rt $step_name $task0_name $task1_name
```
#### moving tasks
```
mt $step_name_from $step_name_to $task0_name $task1_name
```
#### activating tasks
```
act $step_name $task0_name $task1_name
```
#### deactivating tasks
```
det $step_name $task0_name $task1_name
```
#### removing tasks
```
rt $step_name $task0_name $task1_name
```


# Why did I even created this...
well I wanted to finally finish something, and because of my natural time-wasting talent I decided to write my own time-management-ish software.

# It looks bad
yeah, I can't CSS too well
